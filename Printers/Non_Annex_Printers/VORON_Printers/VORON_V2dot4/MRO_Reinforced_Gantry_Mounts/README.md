Based on the z-joints from the Annex Redoubt but modified to use 20 mm screws instead of 12 mm. 

Uses all the same BOM parts as the original. They require the whole gantry to be taken out of the frame in order to be installed. There is also added material around the screws, if side panels are flush mounted they will interfare with the gantry mounts.
