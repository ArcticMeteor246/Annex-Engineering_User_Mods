**Backpack Rightside PTFE Guide (Press Fit)**
============

- Notes
   - Remixed from Long's PTFE mount which uses a screw-in piece. (See: https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Annex-Engineering_User_Mods/tree/main/Printers/K3/long-right_side_PTFE_tube_guide )
   - Uses EASUN press-fit Bowden connectors.
- Printing
   - Same thickness spacer (3mm) as Long's model; for thinner pieces, I suggest shimming both sides with some tape. Adjusting the model Z height will skew filament path.
