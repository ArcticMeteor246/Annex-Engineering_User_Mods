**K3 Door Seal and LED Bars**
============
![image](./Images/Front_View.jpg)

### Notes
- This is based off of long's LED Mounts and front door seal with the following changes:
  - Side Mounts: Moved zip tie mounts down 3mm to align with LED Bars
  - Front Mount: Heightened by 6mm to fill the distance from tophat to motor mounts
- Can use any generic ARGB strips cut to length, however I use [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CDTEJBG/)
### Printing
- Standard Annex settings
- Print Diffuser in clear, white, or leave it out for full brightness
### Assembling
- The LED Holders need to be mounted to the mounts before the LED strip is inserted
- You can wire the LED strips before or after inserting into the holders
- Diffuser is thin enough to bend / slide into the holder on the front mount
- Ensure your LED Power source can handle the number of LEDs used
